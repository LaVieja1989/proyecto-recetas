Hi, people! I made this program mainly to entretain myself and prove that I was able to implement some ideas in code. But at the same time I thought that perhaps it could be of inspiration for other coders.

The program itself is very messy, that is for granted. I would rather you explore it than me explaining it, because at the end of the day is not very complex and there a couple of secret functionalities that I would like people to discover (nothing special, just easter-eggs).

To run the program itself, just initialize the program form init.py. You can either start from cero and erase some silly files that I left for you to enjoy, or you can choose to not to.

All constructive feedback will be appreciated. Contact me at assemblyworker@gmail.com
