Ingredients:

    1 pre-made pizza dough (or make your own)
    1/2 cup of tomato sauce
    8 oz. of fresh mozzarella cheese, sliced
    Fresh basil leaves
    Olive oil
    Salt and pepper to taste


Instructions:

    Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).
    Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired size and thickness.
    Transfer the dough to a baking sheet or pizza stone.
    Spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edge.
    Add the sliced mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce.
    Drizzle a little olive oil over the cheese and season with salt and pepper.
    Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
    Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil leaves.
    Let cool for a few minutes, slice, and serve hot.
