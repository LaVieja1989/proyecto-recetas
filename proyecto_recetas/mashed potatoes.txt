Ingredients:

    2 pounds of potatoes (russet potatoes work well)
    1/2 cup of milk
    4 tablespoons of butter
    Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

    Peel the potatoes and chop them into chunks of roughly equal size.
    Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill it with enough cold water to cover the potatoes by an inch or two.
    Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat to medium-high. Let the potatoes cook until they are fork-tender, which should take around 15-20 minutes.
    Drain the potatoes and return them to the pot.
    Add the butter and milk to the pot and use a potato masher or fork to mash the potatoes until they are mostly smooth.
    Season the potatoes with salt and pepper to taste.
    Continue mashing and stirring until the mashed potatoes are the desired consistency. If they seem too dry, add a little more milk.

Serve hot and enjoy!
